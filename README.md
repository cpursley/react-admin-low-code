# React Admin Low Code

This is an example [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/) application (configuration based CRUD admin UI builder) demonstrating how to use the [ra-data-hasura-graphql](https://github.com/Steams/ra-data-hasura-graphql) data provider with a [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) (automatic GraphQL API backend on top of PostgreSQL). By combining these two technologies, you can build an entire back office admin suite in a matter of hours. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
